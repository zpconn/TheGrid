TheGrid
=======

TheGrid is a mass-spring grid simulation that exists on the edge of stability, providing some epileptic visual effects.

Left-clicking will expand the grid away from that point; right-clicking will suck it in. The bright flashing colors make this a psychedelic experience.

TheGrid is built on the Gas game engine.
